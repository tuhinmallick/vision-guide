# Image Detection App

This project is a web-based application for object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. It allows users to capture images from their device's camera or upload images from their device, process them through an object detection API, and hear the detected objects using speech synthesis.

## Features

- **Image Capture and Upload**: Users can capture images directly from their device's camera or upload images from their local storage.
- **Object Detection**: Utilizes a YOLO object detection model to identify objects within the uploaded image.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Allows users to listen to the names of detected objects via a built-in speech synthesis feature.
- **Image Preview**: Displays a preview of the uploaded or captured image before processing.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.
